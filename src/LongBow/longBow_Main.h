/**
 * Run one or more LongBow Test Runners.
 *
 * The encapsulating function creates one or more `LongBowTestRunner` instances and supplies
 * these as a NULL terminated variable argument list to the longBowMain function.
 * The return value from longBowMain is suitable as an exit status from an executable as zero is success.
 *
 * @param [in] argc  The number of elements in argv.
 * @param [in] argv  An array of C string arguments.
 *
 * @return 0 All tests for all LongBowTestRunners were successful. Otherwise one of `LongBowStatus`.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * @code
 * int
 * main(int argc, char *argv[argc])
 * {
 *   LongBowTestRunner *testRunner = LONGBOW_TEST_RUNNER_CREATE(MyTestRunner);
 *   int exitStatus = longBowMain(argc, argv, testRunner, NULL);
 *   longBowTestRunner_Destroy(&testRunner);
 *   exit(exitStatus);
 * }
 * @endcode
